                            This is the project I am currently working on, and have worked on for a while. After years of not finishing anything other than game jam entries, and endless prototyping,
                            I am now doing what might amount to the most idiotic thing of all - making something I really want to make, with a large scope! My entire life I've been in love with stealth
                            games, with Metal Gear Solid being the main receiver of that love.<br/><br/>
                            
                            Since then stealth games have evolved by incorporating player choices, making a lot of the stealth gameplay
                            fall behind more meaty action. The newer Deus Ex games, for example, could be played entirely as shooters. In Hitman, the player can get out of a messy situation by pulling out
                            a huge automatic rifle and blowing the enemies to bits. As I understand it this is done not entirely in the name of player freedom, but for accessibility. Stealth games are a niche
                            genré, and can be very off putting for players that don't enjoy the time it takes to progress through a level.<br/><br/>

                            The main focus of this game project is to create a stealth game that is faster, with smaller chunk sized levels that allows for a lot of creativity - all in the name of avoiding
                            violence and killing. I want to make a game that doesn't wave the violence in front of the player, but still being quite action oriented. I draw influences from Metal Gear Solid,
                            Deus Ex, Thief and Dishonored - and I hope to show you more soon.

                            My name is Andreas, and I'm a programmer. In my spare time I make games because I have a passion for it. I'm based in the south of Sweden and I mainly (almost exclusively) work
                            in GameMaker Studio 1.4 and 2.
